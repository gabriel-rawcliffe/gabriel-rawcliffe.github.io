        <h2>Things I learnt about myself:</h2>

        <ul class="values-ul">
          <li>
            <strong>Too worried about knowing the "answer":</strong> I realised
            that early in the process I was concerned about getting the "right
            answer" instead of coming to a better understandng about what was
            going on.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>I'm self conscious about my work:</strong> I think that
            because I have been an expert in my field for so long, being a
            complete beginner makes me feel very vulnerable, and so the idea of
            people seeing my work makes me really nervous
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >I feel a bit weird about people consciously listening to
              me:</strong
            >
            I think because I feel like I'm forcing someone to listen to my
            rambling. I think it would be different if I felt like I was
            conveying an interesting idea.
          </li>

        <h2>
          Role of values, empathy, and slef awareness in learning and
          programming
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our values tend to effect how we approach every situation, problem, or
          conflict, so if we are self-aware about what our values are, and where
          they come from it makes us better able to recocgnise why we might feel
          a particular way, or how we might react to a given situation. This
          also allows us to be more empathetic to other peoples positions as we
          don't all have the same values. In learning and coding these are all
          important, as in either environment we will likely encounter problems
          we need to overcome, or situations where we need to be empathetic to
          someone elses position, previous experiences, or current knowledge. I
          think being self-aware about our own limitations and strengths is
          extremely important for learning.

        <h2>What about core content surprised me?:</h2>
        <p>
          I think I was a little surprised by how well the little things I
          realised about myself in the core content, complimented the learning I
          was doing in Tech.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2>Challenges in core:</h2>
        <p>
          Being honest with myself about my own pre-conceived ideas about
          learning and my own abilities
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Why do I think we do the core work?:</h2>
        <p>
          If I believe ADA, it's because the tech industry is looking for well
          rounded humans, who might be able to code a bit. Also I think because
          of what I have mentioned above it actually helps us to learn the tech
          stuff. Also more good humans in the course makes it more fun for
          everyone involved!<br />
          And realistically there may be a time in the not too distant future
          where the AI can code everything way better and faster than any human,
          so trying to turn us into coding robots is a waste of time. So in that
          future being a good person have around because I'm not a dick, and
          having the abiity to pilot the AI with my understanding of the coding
          process, will make me a desirable job candidate.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Was all the core a waste of time?:</h2>
        <p>
          No, for a few reasons. Firstly, as mentioned I think it makes us
          better at learning. Secondly, I think it will make us better at
          working together in Bootcamp. Thirdly, it will likely make us more
          employable. Fourthly, There is only so much tech my brain can handle
          in a week! Fifthly, more thoughtful people makes for a better society.
