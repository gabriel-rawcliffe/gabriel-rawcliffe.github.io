        <h2>How does Javascript relate to HTML and CSS?</h2>

        <p>
          If HTML defines the main structure of a web-page, and CSS defines its
          styling, Javascript is responsible for the any actions that take place
          within a page. That might be bringing up warning messages, changing
          the way an element looks, responding to text inputs, and many many
          more things. Javascript interacts directly with the HTML file of a
          page, altering elements within it, but does not interact directly with
          the CSS file of a page. Instead it can alter the styiling of a page by
          modifying which CSS are applied to what elements of the HTML.
          <br />
          <br />
          An analogy could be to a car - the HTML would represent the parts and
          their position, the CSS whether they are fixed or free to move and the
          color, and styling of those parts, and the JavaScript is how we
          interface with the car. E.g. what action occurs when we push the
          accelerator or the break? The light that comes on when we are low on
          fuel etc

        <h2>Control flow & loops</h2>
        <p>
          Control flow refers to the order in which statements and executed for
          given code. Typically a computer will read the code systematically,
          from top to bottom and execute the each section as it reads it.
          However, various statements in the code will alter the flow of the
          code is read and what is executed. Imagine the flow of data through
          the code as water. Usually it flows down hill, simply finding its way
          to the bottom, unless it encounters some sort of obstacle, this could
          be a statement of some sort.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Conditional statements:</strong><br />
          These statements include <em>if</em>,<em>else</em>, and
          <em>else if</em>, and when the computer incounters one of these
          statements the flow of the code is altered depending on whether the
          statement is true of false. In the case of conditional statement ou
          water has reached a set of doors, leading in different directions.
          Depending on what has occurred, any of the doors could open, but on
          any given occassion, only one will open,csending the water in one
          direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Loop statements:</strong><br />
          These statement allow you to repeat a block of code for a defined set
          of conditions is met, or for a specific number of times. Loop
          statements include <em>for</em>, <em>while</em> and
          <em>do...while</em>. In a <em>for</em> loop, the code repeats for each
          of the objects in a set, or a specific group of objects from a larger
          set. If our water meets a loop statement it would be like there are a
          set of cups it has to fill, before being able to continue downwards
          through its path

        <h2>The DOM</h2>
        <p>
          The Document Object Model (DOM) is a structure where every single
          element of an HTML file is given a specific
          <em>object</em> representation, and all those objects are aranged with
          a specific heirarchy. Javascript interacts with the HTML file via the
          DOM. When we use Javascript to refer to an aspect of the HTML, we do
          so using its object representation. The <em>document</em> object is
          the typical access point to the html elements, and we reference it in
          JS to access the html elements within
        </p>
        <p>
          We can use JavaScript and the DOM to do almost anything to the way our
          HTML displays on screen. In the below example the getElementsById()
          method searches the DOM for the object representation of the HTML
          element with the ID='myParagraph'. We can then use Javascript to
          manipulate the HTML, in this case changing the text content, and the
          background color.

        <h2>Data as arrays and objects</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Accessing data from arrays:</strong><br />
          Arrays are ordered collections of values, where each value is assigned
          a numeric index starting from 0.<br />
          To access data from an array, you use square brackets [] with the
          index value inside to specify the position of the desired element.<br /><br />
          <img
            class="screenshot2"
            src="../images/array-screenshot.png"
            alt="code showing haw to access datqa from an array"
          /><br /><br />

          It is simple to loop through data in an array using the
          <em>for</em> command, or to change data in arrays using:
          <em>push()</em> which adds new elements to the array;
          <em>pop()</em> which removes the last elemnt from the array and
          returns that element; <em>slice(a, b)</em> which extracts a defined
          portion of the array (from index value 'a', to the index value
          preceding 'b')and creates a new array, but leaves the original array
          unalteredl; and <em>splice(x, y)</em> which creates a new array
          starting with index value 'x', and includes 'y' number of values. The
          values in the new array are removed from the original array.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Accessing data from objects:</strong><br />
          Objects are collections of 1 or more values where each value has a
          unique property name (key).<br />To access data from an object, you
          use dot notation (object.property) or square brackets [] with the
          property name inside (object['property']).<br /><br />
          <img
            class="screenshot2"
            src="../images/object-screenshot.png"
            alt="code showing haw to access data from an object"
          /><br /><br />

          Looping through objects requires different commands than arrays. One
          option is a "for...in" loop which will iterate over the object based
          on the specifics of the command. <em>Object.keys()</em> - returns an
          array of the property names of an object. <em>Object.values()</em> -
          returns an array of each of the values of an object.
          <em>Object.entries()</em> - returns an array of each of the key-value
          pairs of an object, where each pair is represented as a sub-array.<br /><br />

        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <p>
          Functions are blocks of code that can be defined and called to perform
          a specific task or set of tasks. They are like a set of instructions
          to perform a specific task that will be performed everytime the name
          of the instruction manual is referenced.

        <ul class="values-ul">
          <li>
            <strong>Reusability:</strong> Allows you to write a piece of code
            once and reuse it multiple times throughout the program
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Modularity:</strong> Helps break down complex tasks into
            smaller, manageable units. This makes things easier to understand
            and debug
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Isolation:</strong> You can define elements within a
            function such as variables, that only exist in the context of the
            function, making it easier to isolate things with sections of the
            code
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Readability:</strong> Can make it easier to follow code with
            well named and indented functions.
