        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity refers to the brains ability to strengthn existing and
          form new neural pathways and networks throughout life. When we learn
          something new, or build on an existing skill, we are tapping into the
          brains ability to change and develop.
        </p>
        <p>
          By understanding neuroplasicity and the mechanisms that build and
          strengthen neural pathways we can focus our learning into methods that
          will give us the best chances of success. Also simply knowing that
          skills and knowledge are things that our brain is designed to develop
          over time actually makes us more likely to succeed in building new
          pathways in our brain

          <strong>Methods to Improve Neuroplasticity</strong>
        </p>

        <ul class="values-ul">
          <li>
            <strong>Learn new things:</strong> Challenging your brain with new
            stimuli (e.g. learning a new skill, instument or hobby) stimulates
            the formation of new neural connections.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Physical exercise</strong> Regular exercise can enhance
            neuroplasticity and cognitive function by increasing levels of the
            protein, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which promotes
            the growth and survival of brain cells.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mental stimulation:</strong> Doing puzzles, brain-teasers,
            reading, or playing strategy games improves.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Socialise:</strong> Interacting with others, conversation,
            and group activies promote neuplasticity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mindfulness:</strong> Practicing mindfulness and meditiation
            improve focus, reduce stress and enhance brain health, which in-turn
            promotes neuroplasicity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sleep:</strong> Getting enough sleep is important for memory
            consolidation
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Healthy diet:</strong> Nutrition is important for brain
            health; get enough omega-3, antioxidants, and vitamin-B.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Practice:</strong> Repetition of a skill either physically,
            or mentally, strengthens existing neural pathways. Diverse practice
            methods will give better results.

        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p>
          In general a <em>Growth Mindset</em> is about our perception of
          learning obstacles and set-backs. If we have a closed mindset when we
          encounter something we don't understand or get something wrong, we
          would quicklyy close ourselves off to learning opportunities. Closed
          mindset in the context of learning is typically very outcome focussed,
          where the goal is to get the correct answer.<br />
          If we have a growth mindset, when we don't understand something, or
          get an answer wrong, it is perceived as an opportunity to develop our
          skills and knowledge. Growth mindset is typically more process
          oriented, where we perceive success when we have actively engaged with
          the process of learning, even if we haven't yet got to a "correct
          answer".
        </p>
        <p>
          This is important to my learning journey as I think I can sometimes to
          too focussed on finding an "answer", particularly if I feel others
          around me know how to do something. However, this is such a
          short-sighted approach, as unless I am using the answer to properly
          engage with the process that was taken to get there, it will not help
          me in future challenges.

        <h2>Integration into my learning plan</h2>
        <p>
          Based on the information about neuroplasticity, I will be taking time
          within my learning plan to keep my brain primed to learn! This will
          include time for <em>exercise</em>, <em>socialising</em>,
          <em>good food</em>, <em>games</em>, and <em>rest</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will also make sure that whenever I am learning new things, or
          encounter a problem, I see it as an opportunity to grow. I will focus
          on the process of learning, not the goal of getting a specific answer.
