                  I was working on coding challenge that required me basically
                  add a category called 'win' inside of these different things
                  called objects. I was pretty excited, because I felt like I
                  was getting the hang of theis coding thing, and confidently
                  strode ahead with my code. Unfortunately, when I tested it, it
                  came back with a big <strong>FAIL</strong>. Luckily i could
                  look at the test, which was provided by the kind folks at DAA,
                  and see the part of my code that the test didn't like. This
                  part of the code was meant to look at my array of objects
                  (kind of like a list of objects), select a specified object,
                  and grab out a particular item from within that object. Now
                  having been doing this Javascript thing for 9 days, I was
                  shocked!
                  <em>What? This can't be! I'm certain that is right!</em> I
                  thought to myself. But alas, no matter how many times I saved
                  my file and ran the test, I still got the big
                  <strong>FAIL</strong>.

                  So first I tried a few things that I was pretty sure wouldn't
                  work, and they didn't. I talked myself through that part of
                  the code to make sure the logic worked. By doing this, I had
                  an incling that the problem probably lay in the way I was
                  specifically but autaomatically selecting my object as the
                  code looped though the whole array. But was stuck as to what
                  to do. I Googled around for an answer, but struggled to find
                  my specific issue, so eventually I copied my code into ChatGPT
                  and asked it for help. It quickly pointed out the small error
                  I had made, and how to easilly solve it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Throughout I felt a little frustrated, as I was so sure I had
                  done everything right. And then once I had the solution I was
                  actually pretty happy, as although it was a simple error, and
                  a simple fix, I don't think it was something I could have
                  easily foreseen given my current knowledge.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The process reminded me that I am still learning so much, and
                  there are so many specific instances that I have not been
                  exposed to. Also trust error messages, they are not lying.
                  Specifically, I learned that
                  <em>
                    (technical) functions within for loops retain reference to
                    the variable iterator 'i', but do not capture the value of
                    'i' at the moment the function is executed. Therefore, if I
                    want to use [i] to reference a postion in an array I need to
                    first define a variable = to 'i' outside the function, that
                    I reference instead of 'i' inside the function.

                The problem was that I had to make a function (a bit of code that applies a process to a specific input) that would take a sentence, and capitalize the first letter of each word. A reasonably simple concept, but it takes a few steps.
                </li>
                <li>
                To tackle the problem I first wrote out the basic steps I needed to take (in pseudocode), and tried to come up with methods for each step. If I didn't know a method for a particular step I researched it on Google and ChatGPT. When I found all the methods I thought I would need I added them to my pseudocode plan. I then tried writing the code, if I didn't know the precise way to write a particular method (syntax) I would research an example to use as a template for that part of the code. Once I had what seemed like workable code, I used the test for this particular challenge, and found that my solution worked. Once it was complete I wondered if I could make the code a little sleeker, so I actually pasted my code into ChatGPT, and asked if there was any way I could simplify the code, and I learned about method stacking! So I re-wrote the function and got something super sleek. 
                </li>
                <li>
                 During the process I felt really in control because I had a plan of attack, and also at least a basic idea of what methods I would use to achieve it.
                </li>
                I learnt the benefit of planning a skeleton for how the code is going to work. Having an idea of the overall flow makes it obvious where the gaps are, and what those gaps require to fill. Also method stacking...

          <h2>Asking for help...</h2>
          <p>
          A time when I was reluctant to ask for help was almost everytime I have an issue. I think there has only been one occasion where I felt I was stuck enough to need outside help. Most the time I feel like I'm making progress towards an answer, and while I think it takes me longer to get to the final answer the process actually helps in my own understanding. Although I think there are definitely times in retrospect where I should have saved some time and asked a human!
