        <h2>What I think my core values are:</h2>

        <ul class="values-ul">
          <li>
            <strong>Humility:</strong> Not in the sense that I am not confident
            in myself, but in that I don't believe I have anything inately
            special, above others. Even if I was given the highest award in the
            land, I would not feel like that made me inately better than others
            around me (I hope!)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compassion and kindness:</strong> I do my best to help
            people who are sufferring, and to understand their suffering,
            whether it be helping a friend with a mental health problem, or
            helping a stranger in need.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Open-mindedness:</strong> I am open to others points of
            view, culture, identity, and ideas. I tend to give peopoe the
            benefit of the doubt, and give people second chances.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Determined:</strong> I stick to a task, sometimes to a
            fault. I do tend to only work at things I am passionate about
            though.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Ethical decision</h2>
        <p>
          <em>The situation:</em><br />
          A friend who has a severe eating disorder was in a really bad way
          physically (hadn't eaten to the point where they were struggling to
          walk around). They assured me they would be ok, and that they would
          eat soon, and that tehy were not at their worst, and that they were
          "fine". I had to decide whether I would call emergency services, which
          in the circumstance would lead to them being comitted to an intitution
          against their will, for an unknown amount of time. They had already
          said that they never want to go back to this place, and the situation
          would completely derail their life (what life they had left). I was
          also aware that I was one of the only people in their life that they
          actually trusted, and sending them to hospital would mean they woud
          lose that. I was fearful they might die.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Role of values in my decision</em><br />I had to weigh up
          compassion I had for her mental situation, vs her physical well being.
          I was open to the idea that I didn't fully understand her situation,
          both mentally and physically, and I had to use my best judgement to
          decide someone elses future for them. I ended up not calling emergency
          services.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Reflecting on the decision</em><br />I am still uncomfortable with
          the decision, as I think I allowed my best judgement to be swayed by
          my compassion for their situation. However, I'm also aware of how
          important autonomy is to my friend, and the alternative would have
          removed all autonomy from their life. I don't have the benefit of
          hindsight on this yet as it's an ongoing situation, and as of writing
          this I might still call emergency services today. I actually thought
          writing this might help me process the information and make a decision
          about how to move forward, but I'm still very much in the same
          position.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Culture, family, & chosen family</h2>

        <p>
          I don't have a strong cultural identity within my family, but I think
          that my open-mindedness and determination began with my upbringing. I
          don't ever remember my parents being bigotted, and to an extent were
          exposed to a lot of different people and perspectives. I think my
          determination comes from sport, and the people I played hockey with
          growing up, and my mum. But I feel like my identity and values were
          really honed by the people around me while I was studying my PhD. I
          was lucky enough to have a cohort of accepting, diverse, passionate,
          friends from who I learnt a lot about myself and others. So now,
          despite all of those friends having moved on to other places, I find
          that the people I surround myself with now refelct the person I am
          now, and continue to infuence me to grow.

        <h2>Strengths</h2>
        <ul class="values-ul">
          <li class="values-li">
            <strong>Focussed:</strong> I am able to really hone in on tasks and
            become a little single-minded at times. While this can be
            detrimental if not adjusted for, it will allow me to dive deep into
            the material in this course, and commit the time to it that it
            probably needs
          </li>
          <li class="values-li">
            <strong>Logical:</strong> Through studying, and being a research
            scientist, I have developed logical thought processes. This will
            help specifically with coding, as it is a logic based discipline,
            but I am also able to "logic" myself into having breaks an doing
            things I like, as I can use evidence about learning etc to show that
            it will be benificial
          </li>
          <li class="values-li">
            <strong>Research:</strong> I am a very good researcher. I think the
            one thing a PhD gives you above anything else is the ability to
            effectively Google stuff. This is going to be very helpful as a lot
            of the course seems like it will be about finding the right
            information for a given context
          </li>
          <li class="values-li">
            <strong>Problem solving:</strong> Linked very much to above research
            and logic sections. I also think I am good a breaking down problems
            into smaller issues that are simpler to overcome. Coding is all
            about overcoming problems right?!
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <ul class="limits-ul">
          <li class="limits-li">
            <strong>Procrastination:</strong> I struggle to get started on tasks
            that I don't want to do, and to finish tasks that I no longer care
            about. I'm hoping it wont negatively effect my learning in this
            course as I have strategies to overcome this known issue, and also I
            am hoping to be excited and passionate about this new field
          </li>
          <li class="Limits-li">
            <strong>Seeking Help:</strong> Askng for help: I am not the best at
            asking others for help. If I don't get over this, it will likely
            make my learning journey much more difficult than it needs to be,
            both in the course work, as well as personally, as I will likely
            need extra help in my outside life during the busier parts of the
            course
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Conflict resolution example</h2>
        <p>
          I was the coach of a hockey team going to an under 21 national
          tournament. Some of the guys in the team would at times show up
          hung-over to trainings, which would affect their performance and the
          ability of others to get the most out of the training. This was
          causing tension in the team. So as a group we developed a set of team
          "ethics" which each of the guys agreed to.
        </p>
        <p>
          The strategy was very effective, I think mostly because it created a
          sense of mutual buy in from the group. The biggest change I would make
          would be to do a similar process right from the start of the season!
