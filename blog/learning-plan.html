        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <p class="dotted red">
          <em>Fulfillment:</em><br />
          I want to do work that gives me a sense of fulfillment, and productivity. I'm not overly worried about being the "boss", or rising throught the ranks at whatever job I have. But I would like to work on projects that are intended to make meaningful change to people who need it. 
        </p>

        <p class="dotted blue">
          <em>Flexiblity</em><br />
          I would like a career that allows me to work (within reason), when and where I want to. My life isn't my career, and I don't ever see that changing, so I want my career to be flexible enough to let me do the things I love.
        </p>
    

        <p>
          <em>Financial Freedom</em><br />
          I don't care about making millions of $$, but I don't want to be destitute. I want a career that gives me enough money to do the things I love, support causes I care about, pay the mortgage, and not be scared when to take my car in for a WOF.

              <li>
               <strong>Dedication:</strong> When I am interested in a project I a will work on it with super levels of passion and drive
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Research:</strong> I'm great at researching things I don't know which allows me to problem solve quickly

               <li>
                  <strong>Time management</strong> I sometimes don't know when to move on to a new task, so spend too long on deep dives and tangents

        <h2>Personal Development:</h2>
        <p>
          I want to see my ability to work discretely on a single part of a large project improve. I have often been in positions where I work in a group/team, but within a project that is very separate to the rest of the team. Because of this, I think I tend to be bad at not having complete control over a project.
        </p>

        <p>
          I want to improve my time management, which I think will help me to overcome some of my previous procrastination issues.
        </p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Workload Management + Asking for Help</h2>

        <p>
        I plan to set specific workimng times for each day, and allocate times for recreation and self care. Then I will do my best to stick to these plans, or at least the overall allocated "work" time each day/week. This will also involve communicating to other people, when I will and wont be available. I know that, for me, if I can squeeze in some recreation, even if for a short time, it will do a lot to make me happy even if doing long hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          When things get hard, I will talk to my friends, my wife, and course facilitators. I will make sure problems don't snowball by talking to people when I get stuck, and by accepting I don't have all the answers. For technical issues I will use discord (#tech-question), or if need be DM an appropriate Facilitator.

          <h2>Expectations</h2>
          <p>
            I expect the Dev Academy team to provide me with access or direction to the resources I need to work my way through the course, and to be able to offer technical expertise when required. I expect them to be thoughtful about the different level the students are at and the different situtations we are all in. I hope they are not dicks (so far so good!!)
