        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>
          - The ability to recognise, process, and respond to your own feelings
          and the feelings of others.
        </p>
        <p>- It is a skill that can be trained, practiced, and improved.</p>
        <p>
          - It helps us to understand ourselves and our needs, as well as to
          work better with others
        </p>

        <h2>Why is it important</h2>

        <ul class="values-ul">
          <li>
            <strong>Performance:</strong> When we recognise and respond to our
            own feelings and emotions in an appropriate and healthy way, we gain
            insight and perspective that lets us perform better at tasks, study,
            and work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Leadership and teamwork:</strong> Having hi EQ lets us build
            relationships with those around us and make better decisions. Makes
            you less of a dick
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Happiness:</strong> By understanding what we are feeling and
            why we are feeling it, we gain perspective and are more easily able
            to move past self doubt and self flaggelation
          </li>
        </ul>
